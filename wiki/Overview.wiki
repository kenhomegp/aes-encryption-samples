#summary Set of cross-compatible AES encryption samples for different platforms

== Introduction ==

The intent of this project is to help those who'd like to learn how to to encrypt data using standard libraries on different platforms (Java, C#/.Net, PHP, !ColdFusion). Of course, it should be always possible to decrypt data on any supported platform, regardless on which platform the data is encrypted.
